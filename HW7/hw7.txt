HW-7	CS451	10 points	Due: Friday, October 20

On October 20, 1813 the Kingdom of Westphalia was abolished. 
Shocking, I know.

On October 20, 1864 US President Lincoln formally establishes 
Thanksgiving as a national holiday. We will celebrate this 
event with an assignment that is no turkey!

For this assignment you need to write a program that spawns 
10 threads, uses command-line arguments, and that reads and 
writes files. 

The command-line argument will be "mutex" or "nomutex". When
running in "nomutex" mode the 10 threads will each read 1 word
at a time from a file (hw7.data) and write that word to another
file (hw7.nomutex). I suggest you include a sleep() to slow 
things down a bit. After all, you do want the two versions to
produce different results.

When running in "mutex" mode any thread that wants to read a 
word must first set a mutex, when the word is written to the 
output file the mutex is released. The output filename here 
is hw7.mutex.

Output fle format (both files):
word	<tab>	thread_number_that_wrote_word
word	<tab>	thread_number_that_wrote_word
word	<tab>	thread_number_that_wrote_word
   .

Input file format:

In your email, provide a brief analysis of the results (compare
the two output files).

REQUIREMENTS:
-------------
1. Your program MUST run on the cscluster.

2. Your full name must appear as a comment at the beginning 
   of your program.

3. Your source code must be named hw7-yourname.c or
