HW-5	CS451	10 points	Due: Friday, October 6

Write a C/C++ program that uses the PTHREAD library to 
create 3 threads. The program must to the following:

* MAIN will open a file (hw5.out) for writing, then 
  call thread #1, thread #2 and thread #3. MAIN will
  create a global variable (a single character) that
  will be used to pass the characters from the threads
  such that they can be written to hw5.out. MAIN will
  write these characters to the hw5.out file (the threads
  cannot do this). MAIN will also close hw5.out when 
  the threads are finished.

* THREAD #1 will open a file (hw5-1.in) for reading, 
  read 1 character value from the file, and put that 
  value in a global variable. Thread #1 will then wait 
  for thread #2 and #3 before moving on to the next 
  value (in hw5-1.in).

* THREAD #2 will open a file (hw5-2.in) for reading, 
  read 1 character value from the file, and put that 
  value in a global variable. Thread #2 will then wait 
  for thread #3 and #1 before moving on to the next 
  value (in hw5-2.in).

* THREAD #3 will open a file (hw5-3.in) for reading, 
  read 1 character value from the file, and put that 
  value in a global variable. Thread #3 will then wait 
  for thread #1 and #2 before moving on to the next 
  value (in hw5-3.in).

Obviously, you will need mutex(s) for this to work.
Notes:

1. When all of the data has been read, return control 
   to the MAIN routine.

2. The 3 input files will be the same size.

3. I suggest you use the command "fscanf(file,
   "%c\n", &value1)" to read the input files. 

4. The format of hw5.out must be 1 character per line.

REQUIREMENTS:
